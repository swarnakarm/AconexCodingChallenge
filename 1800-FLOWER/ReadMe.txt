I have used this problem out of the three provided one's because as soon 
as I read about the problem I started thinking about it.

Also, I daily use this on my phone for calling someone. 
So, it generated some curiosity on my mind and I started applying logic on my mind before checking other problems.

After reading all the problems, I started with 1800-Coding Challenge as I already started thinking about it.
